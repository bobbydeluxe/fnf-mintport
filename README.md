# 🎤 Friday Night Funkin' - MintPort

`FNF MintPort` is the **base game content mod folder** for [MintEngine](https://github.com/bobbydeluxe/pslice.mint).  
This repo recreates the official FNF content in a way that fully utilizes MintEngine's scripting, visuals, and custom features.

## 📦 About This Repo

This project includes:

- ✅ Rewritten charts for MintEngine  
- ✅ Ported and extended story dialogue using custom Lua systems  
- ✅ Speaker/backing card visuals (like A-Bot, GF's speakers, etc.)  
- ✅ Proper week flow and transitions  
- ✅ Overlay effects and custom cutscene audio  
- ✅ Easy-to-mod structure  

It’s made to run directly in `mods/fnf-mintport/` under the MintEngine directory.

## 🧰 How to Use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bobbydeluxe/pslice.mint
git clone https://github.com/bobbydeluxe/fnf-mintport
mv fnf-mintport pslice.mint/mods/
```
